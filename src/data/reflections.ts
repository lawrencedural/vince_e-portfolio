    content: `The beginning of the course delivered a powerful message about how its activities and lessons can help us grow. On Day 1, we played a game that required communicating non-verbally through gestures to convey ideas. It was challenging and overwhelming at first, especially for someone like me who is naturally introverted. Speaking in front of the class and taking the stage has always been difficult for me.

But I asked myself why I should let these fears hold me back when I had already overcome similar struggles before. I pushed myself, took a big leap, and succeeded simply by being true to who I am. Through this, I realized the internal battles introverts often face, and that staying grounded in my own identity helps me stay composed and avoid unnecessary pressure.

I've also proven to myself that I have the skills to lead communicating effectively, guiding others, and handling responsibilities confidently. As the president of Unbound during our Practicum period, I was able to unleash my potential in running a business venture with leadership, competitiveness, determination, and strong communication skills. Our team even won the award for Best Practicum.

That experience taught me a valuable lesson: believing in yourself and using your unique capabilities not imitating others is what truly helps you flourish. By being myself, I was able to grow, discover my strengths, and continue honing my skills.`,

    content: `During the course discussions in Weeks 3 and 4, I realized how important it is to understand the three persuasive appeals Ethos, Pathos, and Logos. As an Entrepreneurship student, learning these concepts opened my eyes to the different styles of persuasion used both in the business world and in everyday life. Understanding these appeals gave me a clearer sense of how I can communicate more effectively with people, whether in personal interactions or in professional settings.

One of the most significant lessons I learned during these weeks was the value of non-verbal communication. Facial expressions, gestures, and proper tone of voice play a crucial role in how a message is received. When used correctly, these elements can capture people's attention and make them more willing to listen. Adjusting your non-verbal cues based on your environment or audience can greatly improve the clarity and impact of your communication.

I also learned the importance of writing emails properly to avoid misunderstandings. In the business field, where communication is often formal and fast-paced, choosing the right words, maintaining a professional tone, and expressing your thoughts clearly can build credibility and prevent conflicts. Meanwhile, using gestures and facial expressions effectively can help convey seriousness, knowledge, confidence, and even approachability qualities that are essential for entrepreneurs.

All of these lessons are crucial because they provide valuable insights into the kind of communication skills needed in the future. Whether interacting with clients, leading a team, or presenting business ideas, the ability to combine persuasive appeals with strong verbal and non-verbal communication will help me navigate the business world more effectively.`,

    title: "Reflection on the 3 Vs of Communication",
    content: `This week's lesson on the 3 Vs Verbal, Vocal, and Visual helped me understand how important each element is in delivering an effective speech. At first, I struggled because, as an introvert, speaking in front of others is challenging. I tend to focus only on the words I want to say, not realizing that my tone, pace, and body language also affect how my message is received.

The discussion made me recognize areas where I need improvement, such as maintaining eye contact, using proper gestures, and controlling my voice when I feel nervous. However, I learned that communication is not just about speaking, it's about connecting with people.

Verbal taught me to organize my ideas clearly.
Vocal reminded me to use tone and pacing effectively.
Visual showed me how facial expressions and posture build credibility.

These lessons are valuable for my future in the business world. As an aspiring entrepreneur, I will need to pitch ideas, lead people, and communicate confidently. By applying the 3 Vs, I can engage my audience better, build trust, and present myself professionally. This topic made me realize that strong communication is one of the most important skills I can develop for my career.`,

    content: `This module on Employment Communication taught me essential skills that will benefit me both personally and as a future entrepreneur. Learning how to write effective cover letters, résumés, and professional messages helped me understand how to clearly present my strengths, skills, and experiences even with limited work background. The lessons on action verbs, tone, and message structure showed me how powerful communication can be in creating a positive impression.

These skills are important because entrepreneurs constantly communicate whether pitching ideas, negotiating with partners, or responding to customers. Knowing how to deliver positive, neutral, and even negative messages professionally will help me build strong relationships and maintain a good business reputation.

In the future, I can apply these learnings to create better business proposals, present myself more confidently, and communicate more effectively in any professional setting. This module made me realize that good communication is a key foundation for success in the business world.`,

    content: `Weeks 8 to 11 were very meaningful because they focused on skills that are highly useful not only for academics but also for real-world business applications. Learning about Non-Prose Forms (NPF) helped me understand the importance of presenting information visually through tables, charts, graphs, dashboards, and infographics. Before this module, I often relied on long explanations, but now I realize that visual data makes complex information easier to interpret and communicate. Understanding APA formatting for tables and figures also taught me to be more organized and professional in my work. These skills are beneficial for me as an Entrepreneurship student because they will allow me to present financial reports, marketing performance, and business proposals clearly and effectively to partners, investors, and future employees. Being able to interpret data through visuals will support better decision-making, especially when analyzing trends or identifying business problems.

The modules on Business Theories and Data Commentaries further developed my analytical and strategic thinking. Business frameworks like SWOT Analysis, the Marketing Mix, Ansoff Matrix, and Porter's Five Forces gave me structured ways to understand business situations and create plans for growth. I realized that these theories are not just academic concepts they guide real business strategies, especially as I plan to franchise and eventually build my own brand. Meanwhile, the Data Commentaries module strengthened my ability to explain data by using highlighting statements, predictions, implications, expectations, and recommendations. This helped me communicate insights more clearly and confidently. Overall, these lessons shape me into a more competent and prepared future entrepreneur by improving my communication, organization, and decision-making skills. I believe that applying these learnings will help me make informed business choices and manage my future ventures more effectively.`,

    content: `Weeks 11 to 12 of the course gave us the opportunity to concentrate on completing our remaining projects and activities, allowing us to apply and showcase what we have learned throughout the semester. Although there was another chance to perform an impromptu speech, I had already delivered mine during Weeks 2–3. Looking back on that experience, I remember how intimidating it felt at first—the pressure of speaking in front of the class while everyone's attention was fixed on me made me nervous and unsure. Despite those fears, I was able to organize my thoughts, respond to the question, and express myself clearly. That moment taught me that I am capable of handling pressure and thinking on the spot, which is a valuable skill not only in school but also in real-life situations, especially in the business world where communication and confidence are essential.

In these final weeks, I also gained a deeper appreciation for the purpose of creating an e-portfolio. At first, I viewed it simply as another requirement, but I eventually realized that it serves as a meaningful representation of my skills, growth, and accomplishments. The e-portfolio highlights my strengths, potentials, and the competencies I have developed throughout the course, giving a clearer picture of who I am as a student and a future professional. It acts as a personal record of my progress and can be a useful tool when applying for internships, jobs, or presenting myself in professional settings. Overall, these last weeks helped me recognize the value of our outputs, especially in shaping my confidence, communication abilities, and readiness to enter the professional and entrepreneurial world.`,

    title: "Overall Reflection",
    content: `Throughout the whole term, it was challenging yet enjoyable for me, especially since taking a communication course is something outside my comfort zone as an introverted person. Speaking in front of others, expressing my thoughts confidently, and participating actively were things I normally struggled with. However, the way our professor designed and taught each module made the learning experience engaging, supportive, and encouraging. The activities allowed all of us including those who are not naturally confident in public speaking to grow and step out of our shell. From the very first day, when we were asked to communicate non-verbally and "sell ourselves," I already felt the pressure, but that moment also opened my eyes to my own potential. Slowly, I learned how to communicate more effectively, both verbally and non-verbally, and discovered strengths that I did not realize I had. Each module pushed me to improve not by forcing me to change who I am, but by helping me embrace my identity while developing essential communication skills.

Looking back at my journey from Week 1 to Week 12, the improvement I experienced is truly significant. I entered the course unsure, nervous, and hesitant to speak, but I am ending it with more confidence, clarity, and self-awareness. Learning about persuasive strategies, professional communication, the 3 Vs, employment communication, and data presentation helped shape me into a more competent communicator and future entrepreneur. I now know how to structure emails professionally, create résumés and cover letters, present visual data, and analyze business information using theories and frameworks. The impromptu speech experience also taught me that I am capable of thinking on the spot and handling pressure, which is valuable in both academic and real-world settings. One of the biggest highlights of the course was creating an e-portfolio, which allowed me to visually see my growth, achievements, and skills all in one place. It became more than just a requirement it became proof of how far I have come. Overall, this course did not only teach me communication concepts; it helped build my confidence, sharpen my abilities, and prepare me for future professional and entrepreneurial opportunities. I am grateful for the learning experience, and I can proudly say that I am no longer the same introverted student who walked into class on Day 1. I now carry the skills, mindset, and confidence to communicate effectively and represent myself well in the real world.`,
